= About Myself
I am currently interested in gaining basic work experience as an intern in your company. That experience in my opinion will allow me to improve my skills and also will provide a good understanding of industrial and research development.
\\  Having a particular interest in distributed system organization, I want my skills to be enhanced in that sphere for future perspective.
I am considering the industrial approach more valuable in the way it will provide more
complex and interesting tasks.
